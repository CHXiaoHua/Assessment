            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we can connect to the Internet by using a variety of devices, these props have different requirements for the Internet in many ways. As one of the important carriers of the Internet, web pages also need to adapt to the requirements of different devices to optimize the user experience. Responsive web design eliminates the need for programmers to design separate web pages for different network devices. Instead, the web's built-in code adjusts the design of the page based on the screen size and resolution of the device.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive web design is mainly related to media query technology. When the device meets the size of the CSS code requirement, change the size of any part of the page as required by the programmer to achieve the desired effect. By using these techniques, web pages can save resources and improve programming efficiency.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my web pages, I first need to set the viewport to make the browser from different devices change the display effect like dimension and scaling by instructions. In addition, I use percentages to set the widths of each part on the web page. Most importantly, I used the media queries technology to enable web pages to change layout when the browser width is 768px or less.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this assignment, I learned that when we set up a web page, we need to take into account how users access our web page using different devices. Through web responsive web design, users with devices of different sizes can be given the best browsing effect. In conclusion, when developing the front end of a web page, we have to think about the layout of the page from the perspective of the user.
